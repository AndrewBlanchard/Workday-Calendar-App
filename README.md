# Andrew Blanchard Calendar App

Website: https://andrewblanchard.github.io/Workday-Calendar-App/ 

Created a workday calendar building off of existing code. Used the Day.js library in my JavaScript code to help achieve this. 

## Usage
Users are able to fill out a daily calendar and save tasks to each block representing one hour between 9am - 5pm. It is also color-coded so that a gray or uncolored box represents the past, red is the current hour, and green is for future hours. The site works in real-time and also displays the current date at the top.
